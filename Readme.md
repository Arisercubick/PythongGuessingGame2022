# Guessing game in python I made

> Hello to anyone reading this, this was a guessing game I made years back when I got a bit interested

The game is severely unpolished and lack modularization. 
It is near 1000 lines of code of hardcoded levels

> Code was made when I was 15 years old during the summer of 2022

Might share the other projects I made during this time
